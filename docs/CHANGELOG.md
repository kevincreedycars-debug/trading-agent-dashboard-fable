# Changelog

## 2026-07-03

### Added

- Added a new `ADR Reach Research` Backtest / Accuracy sub-tab driven by a checked-in downstream artifact in `data/adr-reach-research.json`.
- Added `backtester/scripts/validate_adr_reach_research.js` to audit supportable OHLC coverage, build the ADR reach artifact, and validate ADR20 windowing, no-lookahead behavior, threshold calculation, weekday reconciliation, and checker invariants.
- Added `backtester/importers/eurusd/download_eurusd_daily_ohlc_alpha_vantage.js` to download deterministic repo-local `EUR/USD` daily OHLC coverage from Alpha Vantage `FX_DAILY`.
- Added `backtester/importers/btc/download_btcusd_daily_ohlc_coinbase.js` to download deterministic repo-local `BTC/USD` daily OHLC coverage from Coinbase Exchange candles.

### Changed

- Kept the new ADR module fully downstream of replay, checker, confidence, and Pair Trade Research logic.
- Implemented ADR reach using the existing repo-local `QQQ` OHLC proxy file for `NQ`, with evaluation-day `Open` as the reference price and previous-close fallback logic preserved for future supportable OHLC feeds.
- Expanded ADR reach support onto `EUR`, `BTC`, `EUR/USD`, and `BTC/USD` using the new repo-local OHLC sources, while keeping `Gold`, `XAU/USD`, and `USD` unavailable until supportable true `XAU/USD` and `DXY` OHLC sources exist.
- Tightened ADR validation so non-BTC assets cannot silently pick up weekend OHLC rows and BTC must preserve weekend calendar handling.
- Expanded the local dashboard smoke script so the new ADR Reach Research tab verifies summary tables, confidence tables, day totals, weekday tables, and console-clean rendering.

## 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added a `Weekday Breakdown` Backtest / Accuracy tab that shows day-of-week performance by displayed headline confidence bucket for USD, EUR, Gold, NQ, and BTC without changing the existing matrices or checker views.
- Added `backtester/scripts/validate_weekday_breakdown.js` to reconcile weekday totals and confidence-bucket totals back to each canonical checker artifact, while enforcing weekday coverage rules for BTC vs non-BTC assets.
- Added flat-aware weekday cells that show ex-flat directional win rate plus `W / L / F / T` counts, including `Flat only` handling when a bucket or weekday has no directional rows.
- Added a `Day Totals` row/table above each asset's confidence-bucket weekday table so users can scan weekday performance before drilling into confidence buckets.
- Added a new `Pair Trade Research` Backtest / Accuracy sub-tab for EUR/USD, XAU/USD, NQ/USD, and BTC/USD using same-date target + USD checker rows.
- Added `backtester/scripts/validate_layer2_pairing_analysis.js` to validate pair-trade coverage, accuracy, combined-confidence buckets, day totals, weekday breakdowns, and conflict/no-trade summaries.

### Changed

- Derived the weekday breakdown directly from the existing deterministic checker artifacts so the dashboard uses stored displayed headline confidence and stored evaluation outcomes instead of recalculating confidence or altering replay/checker semantics.
- Expanded the local Playwright dashboard smoke script to cover the new weekday breakdown tab, verify weekday columns by asset, and keep the Backtest / Accuracy panel free of console errors during the smoke path.
- Updated the weekday breakdown so flats are separated from directional wins and losses the same way the main accuracy matrices treat flat outcomes.
- Extended the weekday validator to verify bucket-to-weekday reconciliation, flat-rate calculations, ex-flat win-rate calculations, and the new day-level totals.
- Added pair-trade research coverage, accuracy, confidence-bucket, day-total, weekday, and conflict/no-trade views without changing Layer 1 replay outputs, checker semantics, flat bands, or headline confidence logic.
- Used combined pair confidence as `min(target headline confidence, USD headline confidence)` and treated same-direction or missing-USD setups as non-trade research outcomes rather than live Layer 2 logic.
- Refined the Pair Trade Research UI so the per-pair KPI cards use the same responsive dashboard grid language as the rest of the dashboard and the confidence-bucket table spacing no longer crushes right-hand percentage columns.
- Replaced the original wide Layer 2 top-summary table with a compact comparison layout, then clarified its terminology so `Trade Days %` and `Strong+ Trade Days %` are defined against matched historical days instead of the broader paired-row count.
- Re-ran lightweight syntax checks, the pair-trade validator, and browser smoke at session close to confirm the current research platform remains stable after the Pair Trade Research UI refinements.

## 2026-06-29

### Added

- Added EUR replay core, historical snapshot builder, historical replay runner, parity fixture, parity script, EURUSD importer, EUR evaluation script, EUR checker builder, and EUR checker artifact.
- Added dashboard support for the EUR 24H matrix and EUR checker alongside the existing USD research views.
- Added linked-warehouse test locking so the Node smoke tests no longer race each other against shared Supabase-backed tables.

### Changed

- Reproduced the live EUR 24H deterministic workflow exactly in replay using the current `exports/eur_layer1_agent.json` node semantics rather than the generic markdown weight table where they differ.
- Generated EUR historical replay coverage for `2024-01-02` through `2026-04-30` where warehouse data allows.
- Unblocked EUR outcome evaluation by importing historical EURUSD series and evaluating EUR primarily against direct EUR/USD movement instead of any USD-style DXY benchmark.
- Set the provisional EUR-only 24H flat band to `0.15` for EUR evaluation and checker generation without changing shared USD evaluation defaults.
- Generated a passing EUR checker artifact with result `602 / 0 / 0 / 0`.
- Updated the linked-warehouse tests to validate stable research invariants instead of brittle global row-count assumptions.

## 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added `docs/CORE_RESEARCH_PHILOSOPHY.md` as the authoritative guiding document for research/backtesting principles.
- Added `docs/PHASE3_HISTORICAL_EXPANSION_REPORT.md` to record the first USD historical expansion attempt and its evidence summary.
- Added `docs/PHASE3_HISTORICAL_WEAKNESSES.md` to capture warehouse and evaluator issues discovered during Phase 3 evidence collection.
- Added `docs/HISTORICAL_DATA_INVENTORY.md` as the warehouse-completeness source of truth for USD replay inputs through end-2024.

### Changed

- Updated backtester and project-memory documentation to reference the new core research philosophy and reinforce that measurement comes before optimization.
- Corrected stale hosting references where documentation still conflicted with the current GitHub Pages deployment model.
- Corrected the historical evaluator so missing or zero close prices are now treated as `NOT_EVALUABLE` instead of false `-100%` benchmark wins.
- Attempted expansion of the USD replay window to `2024-05-31`, confirmed the frozen research framework still runs end-to-end, and documented that the warehouse currently only supports the continuous January 2024 USD window.
- Shifted Phase 3A focus onto historical warehouse completion planning instead of replay or metric changes.

## 2026-06-21

### Changed

- Updated the live `Eco Events Collector` workflow to remove the duplicate-insert failure against `economic_events`.
- Replaced the previous direct Supabase write with idempotent routing: dedupe incoming events, look up existing rows for the run date, update matching rows, and create only unmatched rows.
- Validated the live collector with two immediate reruns; executions `1081` and `1082` both succeeded with no `economic_events_event_date_currency_event_name_event_time_t_key` error.
- Re-exported the updated live workflow into `exports/eco_events_collector.json`.

- Added visual-only Backtest / Accuracy dashboard tab using placeholder mock data.
- Added static `data/backtest.json` placeholder for agent accuracy and variable correlation UI scaffolding.
- Updated `CODEX.md` and project memory docs to require Codex to read memory first, summarise state, and update only changed memory documents at session end.
- Expanded the permanent memory process with startup summaries, milestone updates, session close notes, commit/push expectations, and canonical memory file locations.
- Updated `CODEX_STARTUP.md` to require continuous documentation updates, logical milestone commits, and startup recovery from repository memory.
- Added `docs/ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` as the live checkpoint for the current feature and updated startup rules to read it after `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`.
- Refined `CODEX_STARTUP.md` to use smart staged startup, concise startup summaries, runtime validation against repository evidence, documentation-drift handling, and stricter session close rules.
- Updated supporting documentation to point startup behavior at `CODEX_STARTUP.md` and use `docs/SESSION_NOTES.md` for current session memory.
- Reworked the dashboard to display a derived confidence score as the headline call metric while preserving Bull Case, Bear Case, Net Edge, and Participation as separate diagnostics.
- Added a compact Overview definitions legend beneath the Layer 1 calls.
- Replaced the shared dashboard card top strip gradient with a single navy strip.
- Added shared Layer 1 dashboard normalization so confidence and a 7-day direction outlook are derived reliably from the latest loaded timeframe calls.
- Added an Overview 7-day direction outlook section and updated the current `data/layer1.json` snapshot to carry `confidence` and `seven_day_outlook`.
- Confirmed the public static host is GitHub Pages and that the earlier local confidence commit had not yet been pushed when deployment was checked.
