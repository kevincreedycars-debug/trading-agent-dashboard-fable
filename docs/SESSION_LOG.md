## 2026-06-19

### Session Goal

Start building the AI-assisted development environment for the trading-agent platform.

### Completed

- User confirmed GitHub repository: `kevincreedycars-debug/trading-agent-dashboard`.
- GitHub access confirmed with admin and push permissions.
- Created `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`.
- Created `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`.
- Created `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`.
- Created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Created `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Important Note

An n8n API key was supplied in chat. It must not be committed to GitHub or placed in documentation.

The n8n workspace base URL is still required before API integration can be tested.

### Next

- Add `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Add `issues/active_bugs.md`.
- Add `issues/fixed_bugs.md`.
- Add n8n integration plan once workspace URL is known.

### Session Goal

Add a live dashboard control for running the full n8n Master Orchestrator and showing workflow errors.

### Completed

- Confirmed n8n API access using runtime-only environment variables.
- Listed live n8n workflows.
- Exported expected workflow JSON snapshots into `exports/`.
- Added a dashboard Master Orchestrator control panel.
- Added `data/workflow-control.json` as non-secret webhook configuration.
- Added `data/workflow-status.json` as the dashboard-readable run status contract.
- Added dashboard status polling and error report rendering.
- Verified `script.js` with `node --check`.

### Important Note

The n8n API key was exposed in chat again. It should be revoked after this proof-of-access and replaced with a fresh key stored only in a secure runtime.

### Next

- Add a Webhook Trigger to the live Master Orchestrator.
- Update `data/workflow-control.json` with the production webhook URL.
- Add final status writing in Master Orchestrator so it updates `data/workflow-status.json`.

### Follow-up Completed

- Added a production Webhook Trigger to the live Master Orchestrator.
- Configured all referenced child workflows as active/published so the Master Orchestrator can publish.
- Added a final status builder and GitHub file writer to the Master Orchestrator.
- Updated `data/workflow-control.json` with the production webhook URL.
- Refreshed workflow JSON exports after live n8n changes.
